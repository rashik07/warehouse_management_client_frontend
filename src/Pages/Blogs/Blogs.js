              <strong>1. Difference between javascript and nodejs?</strong>
            </h1>
            <p>
              <strong>Ans:</strong> Javascript is a programming language
              although NodeJS is a Javascript runtime environment. Javascript
              need browser to run. node js helps javascript to run outside the
              browser.Javascript is used on the client-side. Node js is mostly
              used on the server-side.

            </h1>
            <p>
              <strong>Ans:</strong> SQL is a RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT
              SYSTEM and Nosql is Non-relational or distributed database
              system.SQL databases have fixed or static or predefined schema.
              Nosql have dynamic schema

              </strong>
            </h1>
            <p>
              <strong>Ans:</strong> JWT(JSON Web Token), is an open standard
              used to share security information between two parties â€” a client
              and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a
              set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to
              ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is
              issued.How does JWT token authentication? The authentication
              server verifies the credentials and issues a JWT signed using a
              private key. Moving forward, the client will use the JWT to access
              protected resources by passing the JWT in the HTTP Authorization
              header.{" "}
